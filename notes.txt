On iOS, there is a critical crash bug in cordova-plugin-meteor-webapp that can
be resolved by applying the following patch to the Cordova Xcode project:

By default, this app will attempt to make DDP connections to the server
every time the user completes a character and moves on to the next. This
behavior is because the mobile app use a local server to serve static content,
but that server connects to the app's main server to check for changes to that
content. To disable this behavior, run it with a main server at localhost:

  meteor run android-device --mobile-server localhost:3000

Note: Running the app this way will completely break any other client-server
connection as well. Maybe there is another way to disable the DDP client.

One thing that might work is calling Meteor.disconnect().
